# Triangle Hike

Check it out! [Triangle Hike](https://hoomanfor.github.io/triangle-hike/)

Triangle Hike is a social hiking app. When I plan to hike a trail for the first time, I need to know the parking situation and where the trailhead is.

What's the weather going to be like?

Will I have a hiking buddy? 

By clicking on a forecasted time and date, I'll be able to find others who have committed to the hike. Additionally, I can find out where we'll meetup and what the weather's like. 

Happy Hiking!
